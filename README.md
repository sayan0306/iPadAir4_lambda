# iPadAir4_lambda
The iPad Air 4 is currenlty ' Available in October' on the [apple website](https://www.apple.com/ie/ipad-air/).  
This is an AWS lambda function that checks the apple website for iPad Air 4 availability changes.

# System Overview
* A scheduled trigger kicks off the lambda function every 2 hours.  
* The lamdba function scrapes the [apple ipad web page](https://www.apple.com/ie/ipad-air/).   
* If the availability staus has changed, it sends an email to the recepient email address in the [lambda_function.py](./lambda_function.py) file.

  The dependencies are downloaded and placed in the following directory structure `python/lib/python3.7/site-packages/` and uploaded as a zip file.   
  The zip file is available as [lambda_layer.zip](./lambda_layer.zip) on the repo.  
  Create a new layer and upload the [lambda_layer.zip](./lambda_layer.zip) file.

  - Use the [AWS Secrets manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) instead of hard-coding your keys in the source code.
